# OpenPCC
An attempt to reverse-engineer PC Creator game servers

# PC Creator 2
## Already done
### Chat
[message-exchange](https://github.com/pccre/message-exchange) reimplements the chat server in go, works well with the game

### Currency Rate
[currency-exchange](https://github.com/pccre/currency-exchange) reimplements the currency rate server in go, works pretty much flawlessly with the game

### Session Manager
[session-manager](https://github.com/pccre/session-manager) reimplements the session manager server in go, works the same as the game and one of the features is improved

## Planned
- Trading
- Leaderboards

# Other PC Creator games
Not currently planned. Maybe, work will start when PC Creator 2 servers are fully reimplemented
