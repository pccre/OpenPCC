# OpenPCC
An attempt to reverse-engineer PC Creator game servers

# PC Creator 2
## Already done
### Chat
[message-exchange](https://github.com/pccre/message-exchange) reimplements the chat server in go, works well with the game

### Currency Rate
[currency-exchange](https://github.com/pccre/currency-exchange) reimplements the currency rate server in go, works pretty much flawlessly with the game

## Planned
- Trading
- Session Manager
- Leaderboards

# Other PC Creator games
Not currently planned. Maybe, work will start when PC Creator 2 servers are fully reimplemented
